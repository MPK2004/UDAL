## 📌 Overview

**MRF Digital Suite** is an end-to-end operational analytics system designed to ingest, validate, analyze, and report municipal waste-load data from Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs).

The system processes structured CSV data, stores it in a relational database, computes key operational metrics, and generates automated analytical reports (CSV & PDF) along with an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.

This project demonstrates practical data engineering, analytics, and automation workflows in a real-world operations setting.

## 📊 Example KPIs Generated

* Total Waste Processed (kg)
* Revenue Potential (₹)
* Average Daily Waste
* Weekly Waste Trend (Last 30 Days)
* Top Material Category
* Main Destination
* Revenue by Material Type

## 📊 KPI & Analytics Logic

### 🔹 KPI Calculations

The dashboard computes operational KPIs directly from the `waste_records` table using SQL-style aggregation logic:

* **Total Waste Processed**
  Sum of `weight` across all records within the selected time range.

* **Average Daily Waste**
  Computed as the mean of daily aggregated totals over the last 30 days.

* **Today’s Loads**
  Derived from records where `date = current_date`.

* **Material Distribution**
  Aggregated using `GROUP BY material` to compute total weight per material type.

* **Destination Breakdown**
  Aggregated using `GROUP BY destination` to analyze waste routing patterns.

All KPIs are calculated dynamically based on real-time database queries.

### 💰 Revenue Computation

Revenue is calculated using a predefined material rate mapping:

| Material | Rate (₹/kg) |
| -------- | ----------- |
| PET      | 28          |
| HDPE     | 28          |
| Paper    | 11          |
| Glass    | 2           |
| MLP      | 4           |
| Rubber   | 4           |

For each material:

```
Revenue = Total Weight (kg) × Rate (₹/kg)
```

Material-wise revenue is computed after aggregation and then summed to derive total revenue potential.

This approach demonstrates how structured operational data can be transformed into business-impact metrics.

---

### 📈 Weekly Trend Calculation

Weekly trends are generated by:

1. Filtering records within the last 30 days.
2. Grouping by `date`.
3. Aggregating daily total waste.
4. Ordering results chronologically.

This allows visualization of:

* Operational consistency
* Peak processing days
* Volume fluctuations over time

The trend is recalculated dynamically for each dashboard load.

---

### 🔎 Data Integrity Considerations

To ensure KPI accuracy:

* Duplicate records are detected before insertion.
* Invalid or malformed data rows are skipped.
* Append and overwrite modes are explicitly controlled.
* All aggregations are performed after validation.

This ensures reported metrics are reliable and reproducible.
